# JSDrums

## Introduction

JSDrums is an extendend version of the [Javascript30 Challenge](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30).
This project play drums samples when pressing keys. Additionally, I've included the possibility of
clicking in the buttons to play the samples.

This project's version updates the deprecated `event.keyCode` to `event.key`.
